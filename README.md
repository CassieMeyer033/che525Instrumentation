In CHE525 we built a control cabinet and connected two pressure transmitters, Coriolis flow meeter, and an RTD.
We started with a backplate and screwed the rails to it. We then connected the power supply. We connected the circuit breakers to the rails and began connecting the appropriate wires to the correct terminals. We then installed the DeltaV modules to be able to eventually connect the instrumentation the the control system. We opened each piece of instrumentation and connected the wires to the inside of each. We then connected the instruments to the DetlaV connections and were able to turn the instruments on via a cord that connected to an outlet. That cord was connected to the power supply to convert the AC voltage to DC to be able to connect to the rest of the cabinet.

The installed pieces of instrumentation were:
|Tag| Manufacturer| Model| Key Process Parameters|
|-----| ----| -----|-----|
|PIT525A| Endress+ Hauser| Pressure Indicating Transmitter| Pressure|
|PIT525B| Endress+ Hauser| Pressure Indicating Transmitter| Pressure|
|FIT525A| Endress+ Hauser| Coriolis Flow Meter| Flow Rate|
|TT525A| Endress+ Hauser| RTD| Temperature|
